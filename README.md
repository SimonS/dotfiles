dotfiles
========

starting again with dotfiles. Not touched last ones in 3 years.

This one uses [NeoBundle.vim](/Shougo/neobundle.vim), a fork of vundle to manage github-based plugins.

It is heavily inspired by Steve Losh's awesome [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/). (Up to chapter 18 as of this writing).
