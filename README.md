# dotfiles

starting again with dotfiles. Not touched last ones in 3 years.

This one uses [NeoBundle.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), a fork of vundle to manage github-based plugins.

It is heavily inspired by Steve Losh's awesome [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).

Resurrected this thing, needed a way of managing windows and customising MacOS, so been twiddling with hammerspoon.

The Firefox tab counter bit relies on [this fork](https://github.com/cnst/lz4json) of the lz4json utility.
