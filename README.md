# dotfiles

starting again with dotfiles. Not touched last ones in 3 years.

This one uses [NeoBundle.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), a fork of vundle to manage github-based plugins.

It is heavily inspired by Steve Losh's awesome [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).

## .hammerspoon

Contains:

- Little bit of window management, courtesy of the getting started tutorial
- Firefox tab-count menubar. I wrote a little bit about it on [my personal site](https://breakfastdinnertea.co.uk/2020/08/how-many-tabs/).
- Outlook to Roam markdown converter. I should probably write about it, but the tl;dwrite is that it takes outlook meetings for the day and converts them to a format I can paste into [Roam](https://roamresearch.com).

The Firefox tab counter bit relies on [this fork](https://github.com/cnst/lz4json) of the lz4json utility.
